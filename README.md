# numberFinder
I wrote a program to hack a simple game https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tr.name.ekt.birislem

The game aims to find the specified number using 4 operations and 6 specified numbers. You can only use a number once.

It uses `List<int>` and solves the problem with brute force trial and error. 
C++ or array implementations might work faster.
